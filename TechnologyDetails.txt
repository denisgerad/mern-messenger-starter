Technology Details & Their Roles

Below are the components used in this MERN Messenger project and what purpose each one serves.

🔹 Axios – API Communication (Frontend → Backend)

Purpose:
Axios is used in the frontend to perform HTTP requests to the backend API.

Why Axios?

Cleaner syntax than fetch()

Built-in JSON handling

Automatic error handling

Supports request/response interceptors (useful for attaching JWT tokens)

Where it's used:

Register (POST /api/auth/register)

Login (POST /api/auth/login)

Fetch user list

Fetch stored messages

🔹 Socket.IO Client – Real-Time Messaging (Frontend)

The frontend uses the Socket.IO client library to establish a persistent WebSocket connection with the backend.

Why it’s used:

Enables instant message delivery

Receives live updates (other users typing, online status, new messages)

Automatically reconnects if connection drops

Falls back gracefully if WebSockets are blocked

Use Cases in the app:

Notify server when a user logs in

Send a message instantly

Receive messages instantly without refreshing

🔹 Socket.IO Server – WebSocket Messaging (Backend)

This runs inside the Express server.

Purpose:

Creates a real-time bi-directional communication channel

Manages online users

Forwards messages from sender → receiver

Emits events like user-online, message-received

Why Socket.IO?

Works even behind firewalls and proxies

Built-in ping/pong, reconnects, event-based model

Easier than raw WebSockets

🔹 Password Hashing – bcrypt (Backend)

Passwords are not stored in plain text.
bcrypt hashes the password before storing it in MongoDB.

Why bcrypt?

Uses slow, salted hashing → prevents brute force attacks

Even if someone steals the DB, raw passwords are safe

Industry standard for user authentication

Workflow:

User signs up → password hashed using bcrypt

User logs in → bcrypt compares hash instead of plaintext

🔹 JWT Token-Based Session (Backend + Frontend)

After login, the backend issues a JWT token.

Purpose:

Identifies the user without storing sessions on the server

Attached automatically with every Axios request

Used by protected routes like GET /messages/:id

Why JWT?

Stateless → works well with serverless deployments like Render

Secure, fast, and easy to verify

No need to store sessions in Redis

What’s inside the JWT?

User ID

Expiration time

Signature using your secret key

🔹 Socket.IO WebSocket Transport

Socket.IO automatically handles:

Upgrade from HTTP → WebSocket

Transport fallback (XHR polling if WS blocked)

Heartbeats to keep connection alive

Reconnection logic

You don’t need to manage any of this manually.

This is what makes chatting "instant".
